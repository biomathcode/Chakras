    "Description": "The root chakra, or Muladhara, is located at the base of your spine. It provides you with a base or foundation for life, and it helps you feel grounded and able to withstand challenges. Your root chakra is responsible for your sense of security and stability.",
    "Introduction": "The word Muladhara comes from Sanskrit and literally means base support.This chakra is located at the base of the spine, in the perineum. It is the chakra that is connected to the legs and is therefore a **symbol of the earth** and everything that is solid and stable. For this reason it is also the chakra of all the hardest parts of the body, such as nails, bones and teeth. It controls different parts of the body such as the nose, sense of smell, lymphatic system, bone system, prostate and lower extremities. It is usually associated with the color red. **The root chakra or first chakra** symbolizes stability, self-confidence and security and is related to our survival. When it is balanced we feel safe, happy and able to live the present moment, full of enthusiasm and ready to plan our future. It is in fact essential to have solid roots on which to base our whole life, just as the roots for the survival of a tree or the foundations for building a solid house are fundamental.",
    "Effect": "It is in fact essential to have solid roots on which to base our whole life, just as the roots for the survival of a tree or the foundations for building a solid house are fundamental.When **the first chakra is blocked**, we can feel lost, apathetic, distrustful and without self-confidence. We will never feel satisfied in one place and we will tend to change house or country often.Even our body suffers from the blockage of this chakra: we will feel tired and exhausted, we will have problems with our teeth, kidneys and joints.When **it is too open**, opposite feelings are unleashed, such as a strong attachment to material goods and the past, without being able to live the present moment.We oppose to change and we develop a total lack of fear or excessive fear, which can lead us to get into very risky situations or the inability to enjoy the beauty of life.",
    "Balanced": "To balance the chakras you never have to pretend to be what you are not. For example, you don't have to fake pretending to be happy to align it, but on the contrary, if you manage to rebalance it, you will start to feel happy.",
    "Activation": "If you can't do a Reiki session there are several exercises, positions and visualizations you can do to **unlock the first chakra.**The first thing I recommend you do is to find a quiet place where you can be in direct contact with the earth, such as a wood or a garden. The garden at home is also fine! Practice yoga positions that encourage your contact with the earth, such as Vrksasana, the tree position, Tadasana the mountain position.Also do **visualization exercises**. Sit on the ground with your legs crossed and your back upright. Now visualize roots that start from your body and go deep into the ground.As the roots go down, they will carry with them all the negative energies you have accumulated. When you feel ready, call back the roots to yourself, which will go back together with the positive energy of the earth.To help you keep your concentration, you can also listen to the **LAM mantra**, the mantra corresponding to the first chakra, which you can find in the video below. You can also open this chakra by walking (e.g. experiencing walking meditation), doing aerobic exercises, flexing your trunk until you touch your toes while sitting, doing dance or dance exercises, jumping on the spot, doing exercises that enhance self-confidence, practicing yoga, etc..",

    "Lotus": "6 petals with a half-moon inside",
    "Stones": "amber, citrine, topaz, opal",
    "Introduction": "Continuing the journey of ascent of the kundalini, the second chakra we find is **the splenic chakra or water chakra**. Unlike the first one, which indicates stability, this chakra is associated with liquids and therefore with letting go, with the flow, with the capacity for change.The second chakra is the fulcrum that connects the soul with the body**. It is located in the lower abdomen, just below the navel, and is the chakra of emotions, spontaneity, creativity, pleasure and sexuality.The splenic or orange chakra is related to the sexual organs, the reproductive system and the lumbar plexus.",
    "Description": "The sacral chakra, or Svadhisthana, is located just below your belly button. This chakra is responsible for your sexual and creative energy. Itâ€™s also linked to how you relate to your emotions as well as the emotions of others.",
    "Effect": "When **the water chakra is blocked**, it is the emotions that are most affected.We have strong mood swings, we are full of anger, guilt and shame and we are subject to panic attacks. The search for sex is transformed into a mere physical stimulus but without involving emotions. This inevitably leads to unsatisfactory stories with your partners. Physically, problems and pathologies can occur in the lower abdomen, such as kidney stones and dysfunctions of the reproductive system and the menstrual cycle, as well as fluid flow, such as the circulatory system or the bladder. Other consequences of splenic chakra malfunction are sexual repression, fear of pleasure, contempt for sex and energy blockages that limit the expression of one's personality.If **the second chakra is too open**, there is a search for pleasure and immediate but ephemeral satisfaction, developing emotional addictions or addictions related to food, alcohol, drugs or sex.",
    "Balanced": "To rebalance the second chakra, you will have to work on your emotions and your creativity.",
    "Activation": "**Breathing** is also very important to rebalance the splenic chakra. Just like a fluid, in fact, you will have to be able to let the air that you breathe through your whole body flow.The mantra of the second chakra corresponds to the Sanskrit letter **Vam**. Listening to this mantra during practice and meditation will help you rebalance the second chakra. To activate this chakra you can also dedicate yourself to some exercises such as swimming, give yourself long baths, showers, some relaxation in a jacuzzi, or even with dances or dances involving movements and rotations of the pelvis, closely related to sexual relations.",

    "Description": "The third chakra, the solar or fire chakra, is located in the solar plexus, the part of the abdomen that lies between the diaphragm and navel, is associated with the yellow color and involves different parts of your body such as the skin, muscle system, stomach, liver, large intestine and glands and organs at the level of the solar plexus. It is also associated with the eyes, the sight and the muscles of the face.",
    "Introduction": "If the first chakra is connected to stability and the second to flow, **the third chakra** is that of the union of these two elements, namely light, energy, heat and when it is well balanced we feel energetic, self-confident, strong and self-controlling. We are not afraid of the judgments of others and we know how to always be up to the situation and we have no difficulty in managing ourselves and our emotions. It is connected to the digestive system and digestion, which 'devours' food just as fire devours what it finds in its path.",
    "Effect":"When **the third chakra is unbalanced** we can see many negative symptoms, both physically and mentally, especially related to our safety and our digestive system.When it is too closed, in fact, we notice the rise of **insecurity**, low self-esteem, introversion and a strong sense of inadequacy in all situations. On the physical level, however, problems arise such as liver disorders, nausea, ulcers, gastritis, difficulty digesting and coeliac disease.Problems can also appear when **this chakra is too open**, making a person appear very arrogant, aggressive, far too self-confident, constantly seeking power and always feeling the need to self-celebrate to hide their defeats and insecurities.",
    "Balanced":"",
    "Activation": "To rebalance the Manipura chakra you can practice Reiki and all yoga positions involving the abdomen, such as the Navasana, the position of the boat, or the Parivrtta Trikonasana, the position of the rotated triangle.Meditation can also help you. You can choose to do meditation using the **Ram** mantra, found in the video below and which is the mantra of the third chakra, or opt for a guided meditation.You can open this chakra also by running, relieving tension, changing boring habits, breaking routines and doing bow exercises, such as the 5 Tibetan rites (you can find many videos on Youtube).",

    "Lotus": "12 petals with two inverted triangles in the centre forming a 6-pointed star",
    "Stones": "All green stones, in particular Tourmaline and Avventurine",
    "Description": "The heart chakra is the most central chakra. It unites the higher, more spiritual chakras, which represent elements that are in the air, with the lower, more material chakras, which represent elements that are on the ground.",
    "Introduction": "The Anahata also represents the air, which unites the earth with the sky. The fourth chakra is therefore a real link between the top and the bottom, between the ground and the spiritual, and this is also demonstrated by the two triangles within it, one with the tip up, to indicate the sky, and one with the tip down, to indicate the earth.",
    "Effect":"When it is open we are able to **love unconditionally**, showing ourselves generous with others, caring and heartfelt. But we are not totally dependent on others and we can also love ourselves and our lives. Physically, the air is able to enter our lungs fluidly, charged with oxygen, which is transported into the rest of the body by a functional circulatory system.If **the fourth chakra is closed**, the resulting problems are linked to the affective sphere. We are incapable of loving ourselves first of all and consequently also those around us. We become cold and apathetic, always suspicious and circumspect because we tend not to trust anyone.If **it opens too much**, however, our attention will be focused exclusively on others to divert attention from ourselves. But it will not be a disinterested love: we will try to obtain the greatest number of benefits from a relationship, without the intention of giving anything in return.Other consequences of the malfunctioning of the heart chakra are the inability to love, respiratory and cardiac diseases, selfishness, disconnection and isolation.",
    "Balanced":"",
    "Activation": "Then let's see how to rebalance it.The asanas that help to reopen the fourth chakra are all those where the chest is the protagonist, such as the *Anahatasana* or the Dhanurasana, and all breathing techniques, such as Pranayama. As always, **Reiki** can help this chakra to activate and to balance itself.You can also concentrate by listening to the **mantra Yam**, the mantra tied to the fourth chakra, while practicing or meditating.To open this chakra you can also do full-breathing exercises involving large chest openings, help people every day and put aside hatred.",

    "Description": "The Vishuddha chakra is located right at the base of the throat and is connected to the communication, both with others and with ourselves, and to the emotions that result. It controls the neck, throat, hands and arms, and is associated with the bronchial or cervical plexus.",
    "Introduction": "The Vishuddha chakra is located right at the base of the throat and is connected to the communication, both with others and with ourselves, and to the emotions that result. It controls the neck, throat, hands and arms, and is associated with the bronchial or cervical plexus.",
    "Effect":"The **opening of the fourth chakra** also brings great creativity, which is a very powerful way to express yourself. Our social relationships are pleasant and relaxed, we take an intense interest in others with understanding and without judging.Our ability to **concentrate** is also very high. Since we are very predisposed to listening, learning also becomes fast and effective.On the contrary, **the closure of this chakra** leads to not being able to express oneself well or to listen to others. We are unable to say no, we feel extremely shy and awkward and we can no longer express our creativity, either through words or through artistic disciplines.All this leads to a situation of **deep discomfort** that in the long run can make us close so much in ourselves that we do not want or even be afraid to be together with other people. Needless to say, our social relationships will inevitably disintegrate.Even at the physical level we can run into problems, first of all the **thyroid**, but also the breathing and related organs. Illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, mouth ulcers, speech disorders, but also ear aches and pains will appear.When the **chakra is too open and working too much**, we become logorrhoic, never listening to what others tell us. What we say, however, is not what we really think but our conversations will be based on lies and manipulations.We also feel too self-confident and we do not accept criticism, even when it comes from the people we love.",
    "Balanced":"The color of this chakra is light blue and symbolizes transparency. When this chakra is open, in fact, you can express yourself clearly and transparently, with touch, without offending. Your voice is calm and relaxed, you know how to listen to others and you always manage to express what you think and let yourself go.",
    "Activation":"When the **fifth chakra is unbalanced**, what we have to do is bring out our creativity and learn to appreciate silence and listening. It doesn't matter if you have a **creative block**. Try to fight it by painting, writing, dancing or singing, even if the result won't be the best! The important thing is to be able to let go of your emotions.You can practice **Reiki** or even yoga asanas that affect your neck and shoulders, such as Matsyasana, also called the position of the fish.I also recommend you to do meditation, **focusing deeply on your breath**, maybe listening to the mantra of Vishuddha, **the HAM**, which you can hear in the video below.Any other methods to activate the throat chakra? With rotations and movements of the neck, shouting everything you hear in a quiet place, doing vocal exercises, doing singing exercises and pronouncing mantras in a repetitive and systematic way."

    "Description": "The chakra of the third eye is located in the head, between the eyebrows, and is the symbol of intuition and sight beyond appearances and beyond even reality itself.",
    "Introduction":"It is inevitably connected to the eyes but also to the forehead, temples, brain and spinal cord. In this chakra are connected all opposites and all **duality**, such as male and female, reason and intuition, form and substance, body and mind, good and bad.",
    "Effect": "If the flow of energy that crosses this fifth chakra is not blocked, **we get in tune with our higher self**. We become intuitive, aware, concentrated and highly perceptive. We can visualize thoughts and images, empathy amplifies and we can understand what other people think. We see the world for what it is**, in its energy and spirituality, wisely and without prejudice. We can understand the essence of what surrounds us, seeing beyond what we physically see with our eyes.When **Ajna is blocked**, we become selfish, cynical, materialistic, cold and calculating. We only trust what we see with our eyes and can no longer perceive what exists beyond.We can no longer dream or plan our future, **we become insensitive and detached**, without the ability to stay focused on something for long.Physically, the head will be affected: headache, migraine, fatigue, insomnia, neurosis, eye pain and even blindness. But the **sixth chakra can also be too open** and in this case, in addition to the physical pains, we become manic, self-celebrating and tend to blame others for our faults.",
    "Balanced": "The third eye sees what exists beyond these concepts, dissolving the duality to get to see the true reality.It is therefore important that even the sixth chakra is always balanced to maintain inner serenity and a stable relationship with others.",
    "Activation": "To rebalance the third eye chakra, meditation is very important. Through meditation we can communicate with ourselves and with the energy that is around us.It is also important to practice pranayama to learn how to get benefits from our breathing. To open the sixth chakra we can do so by listening to the mantra of the sixth chakra, **the om**.In addition to **Reiki** and meditation, to rebalance the sixth chakra you can do **activities that stimulate creativity** or immerse yourself in nature, paying attention to the small details of life and contemplating the beauty that surrounds us every day, such as a sunset or a starry sky. To activate the third eye chakra you can also do **guided meditations**, visualize simple geometric shapes, massage the temples and eye contour in a circular way, and massage the eyes with the eyelids closed using your fingertips."

We will then feel apathetic, despondent, unwilling to live, depressed.If **it is too open**, then we will be attached to unimportant things, material goods and power, overwhelmed by ignorance and dissatisfaction, and we will always feel anxious, arrogant, impatient.Even on the physical plane we will be affected and suffer from exhaustion, mental confusion, depression, apathy to the point of ending up in psychosis and schizophrenia.Other problems with this chakra can cause the need to dominate and manipulate others to get what you want, the fact of always wanting to be right, bullying, rigidity in the form of thinking, a high ego, materialistic values, the difficulty in concentrating, the difficulty of thinking independently.",
